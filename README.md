# arduinoprojects


This project contains the .ino files of the applications that I tried in the Arduino board. 


generic_music_lights.ino - contains the firmware required to control relay board using the GPIO pins using the hardcoded time delays. You need to reset the Arduino simultaneously while starting to play the music. This can be done using Raspberry Pi using the USB port to download the s/w into Arduino as well as play mp3 using a command line player.
